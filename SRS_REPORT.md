#### **Specific Technical Issues**
- **WebSocket Connection Management**: Handling connection drops, reconnections, and maintaining session state
- **Message Ordering**: Ensuring messages appear in correct chronological order across different clients
- **Room Management**: Properly segmenting conversations by order ID and user permissions
- **Scalability Concerns**: Managing multiple concurrent chat rooms without performance degradation

#### **Solution Implemented**
```typescript
// Socket.io implementation with room-based messaging
class ChatService {
  private io: Server;
  
  constructor(server: http.Server) {
    this.io = new Server(server, {
      cors: { origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL },
      pingTimeout: 60000,
      pingInterval: 25000
    });
    
    this.io.on('connection', this.handleConnection);
  }
  
  private handleConnection = (socket: Socket) => {
    // Join order-specific rooms based on user permissions
    socket.on('join-order-chat', async ({ orderId, userId }) => {
      const hasPermission = await this.verifyOrderAccess(userId, orderId);
      if (hasPermission) {
        socket.join(`order-${orderId}`);
        socket.emit('room-joined', { orderId });
      }
    });
    
    // Handle message sending with persistence
    socket.on('send-message', async (data) => {
      const savedMessage = await this.saveMessage(data);
      this.io.to(`order-${data.orderId}`).emit('new-message', savedMessage);
    });
    
    // Handle disconnection cleanup
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      socket.rooms.forEach(room => socket.leave(room));
    });
  };
}
```

#### **Lessons Learned**
- Connection state management requires careful handling of edge cases
- Message persistence is crucial for maintaining conversation history
- Proper room-based segmentation prevents unauthorized access to conversations

### **2. Complex Role-Based Access Control** 🔐

#### **Challenge Description**
Implementing a sophisticated permission system that supports four distinct user roles (Customer, Junior Baker, Main Baker, Administrator) with hierarchical permissions and dynamic role transitions.

#### **Specific Technical Issues**
- **Permission Granularity**: Defining appropriate permission levels for different features
- **Role Inheritance**: Main bakers having access to junior baker functions plus additional permissions
- **Dynamic Role Changes**: Handling permission updates when users get promoted
- **Frontend Authorization**: Securely hiding/showing UI elements based on user roles

#### **Solution Implemented**
```typescript
// Hierarchical permission system
interface Permission {
  resource: string;
  actions: string[];
}

const ROLE_PERMISSIONS: Record<UserRole, Permission[]> = {
  customer: [
    { resource: 'orders', actions: ['create', 'read', 'update_own'] },
    { resource: 'designs', actions: ['create', 'read', 'update_own'] }
  ],
  junior_baker: [
    { resource: 'orders', actions: ['read', 'update_assigned'] },
    { resource: 'chats', actions: ['read', 'write'] },
    { resource: 'earnings', actions: ['read_own'] }
  ],
  main_baker: [
    { resource: 'orders', actions: ['read', 'update', 'assign'] },
    { resource: 'team', actions: ['manage', 'assign_tasks'] },
    { resource: 'applications', actions: ['review', 'approve'] }
  ],
  admin: [
    { resource: '*', actions: ['*'] } // Full access
  ]
};

// Middleware for API route protection
const authorize = (resource: string, action: string) => {
  return (req: AuthRequest, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const userPermissions = ROLE_PERMISSIONS[req.user.role];
    const hasPermission = checkPermission(userPermissions, resource, action);
    
    if (!hasPermission) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

#### **Lessons Learned**
- Clear permission matrices are essential for maintainable access control
- Frontend and backend authorization must be synchronized
- Role transitions require careful handling of cached permissions

- **Real-time Updates**: Efficiently notifying clients of database changes

#### **Solution Implemented**
```sql
-- Strategic index creation for performance optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_status 
ON orders(user_id, status) 
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'in_progress');

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_messages_order_created 
ON messages(order_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_baker_earnings_date 
ON baker_earnings(baker_id, created_at DESC);

-- Optimized query with proper joins
SELECT 
  o.id,
  o.status,
  o.total_price,
  u.username,
  u.email,
  be.amount as baker_earning
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN baker_earnings be ON o.id = be.order_id
WHERE o.status = 'in_progress'
  AND o.assigned_baker_id = $1
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### **Database Connection Optimization**
```typescript
// Connection pooling configuration
const pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || '5432'),
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  max: 20, // Maximum connections in pool
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
```

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['orders', filters],
    queryFn: () => api.getOrders(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    retry: (failureCount, error) => {
      if (error.status === 404) return false;
      return failureCount < 3;
    }
  });
};

// Optimistic updates for order status changes
const useUpdateOrderStatus = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: ({ orderId, status }: UpdateStatusParams) => 
      api.updateOrderStatus(orderId, status),
    
    onMutate: async ({ orderId, status }) => {
      // Cancel outgoing refetches
      await queryClient.cancelQueries(['orders']);
      
      // Snapshot previous value
      const previousOrders = queryClient.getQueryData(['orders']);
      
      // Optimistically update
      queryClient.setQueryData(['orders'], (old: Order[]) =>
        old.map(order => 
          order.id === orderId ? { ...order, status } : order
        )
      );
      
      return { previousOrders };
    },
    
    onError: (err, variables, context) => {
      // Rollback on error
      if (context?.previousOrders) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['orders'], context.previousOrders);
      }
    },
    
    onSettled: () => {
      // Always refetch after mutation
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['orders']);
    }
  });
};
```

#### **Lessons Learned**
- React Query significantly simplifies server state management
- Optimistic updates improve user experience but require careful error handling
- Proper cache invalidation strategy is crucial for data consistency

import multer from 'multer';
import path from 'path';
import crypto from 'crypto';

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uploadPath = path.join(__dirname, '../uploads');
    cb(null, uploadPath);
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Generate unique filename
    const uniqueSuffix = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
    const extension = path.extname(file.originalname);
    cb(null, `${uniqueSuffix}${extension}`);
  }
});

const fileFilter = (req: Request, file: Express.Multer.File, cb: Function) => {
  // Allow only specific image types
  const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];
  if (allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, and GIF allowed.'));
  }
};

const upload = multer({
  storage,
  fileFilter,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024, // 5MB limit
    files: 5 // Maximum 5 files per request
  }
});

// Frontend upload with progress tracking
const useFileUpload = () => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
  
  const uploadFile = async (file: File) => {
    setUploading(true);
    setProgress(0);
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
        onUploadProgress: (progressEvent) => {
          const percentCompleted = Math.round(
            (progressEvent.loaded * 100) / progressEvent.total
          );
          setProgress(percentCompleted);
        }
      });
      
      return await response.json();
    } finally {
      setUploading(false);
    }
  };
  
  return { uploadFile, progress, uploading };
};
```

#### **Lessons Learned**
- File validation on both client and server is essential for security
